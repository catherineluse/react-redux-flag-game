This is a flashcard game built with React and Redux.

First, use the navigation bar to pick which region to focus on.
Then the game asks you which flag goes with a certain country.
Click which flag goes with that country. If you get it right,
you can go on to the next flag. If you get it wrong, an error
message tells you which flag you clicked instead.

The back of each card has the country crest, emblem, or seal,
which can be used as a hint.
